### Skippy's Story

#### *Behind the scenes*
I've always had trouble setting up a proper discord server, from moderation stuff to help staff, to games to entertain members. There are already a lot of well-made bots in the industry, except that to make a server with everything you need, you need to add 2-3 bots (maybe more), because each one is specialized on certain features.

And I thought, what would a bot look like, containing all the features of the most used bots in the industry? Totally free!

Of course, at first it just seemed crazy because it's a long way to get there. But, it's worth a try, right? That's why I set out to create that all-around good bot myself.

### *To introduce the star of this topic...*

He's ***Skippy***. 

He comes from far away, with thoughts and ideas that will blow your mind... from helping your moderators moderate the server properly, to interactive games that your members will love! And all this things, without asking for anything in return. 

*(good joke, huh?)* No, it's not a joke, ***Skippy*** will be free for a long time, all his features will be available to a wide and beauty audience, but it can't be forever, at some point, we'll need some help to maintain he's house, from buying wood and cutting it for winter, to food (he's very hungry all the time)!

If you didn't catch it from the attached picture, ***Skippy*** is a penguin with good and warm thoughts.

Are you curious what features ***Skippy*** will have? here is a list of everything we would like Skippy to have: [features list](https://leonardssh.notion.site/Skippy-s-Features-cc34485029724517b6c0a6b3e0bfe335)
